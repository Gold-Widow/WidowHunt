// How this works:\
// >) We will display nodes via a recursive algorithm
// >) First, we need to identify every key
// >) Then, for all the keys, we need to identify their values
// >) Then, we display the key and its children using the properties set in the nodebuilder. 
// >) This is done by checking the known nodes list with the keys associated with them.
// 1) Identify
